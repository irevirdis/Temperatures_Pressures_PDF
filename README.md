efficiency_plot: the aim of the script is to check the mean values of a turbine efficiency,
		 given a fixed correlation matrix for pressure and temperatures.

efficiency_variance: the aim is the calculation of the square root of the variance of 
		     turbine efficiency, given a fixed matrix of correlation between 
		     temperatures and pressures.

mapping points: checks the variations of efficiency when points are mapped from physical
		to a new standard space (an inverse Nataf transformation has been used)

order_check: how the efficiency order may change when we map the points with an inverse
 	     Nataf transformation?
