    "## Statistics of the turbine efficiency using Polynomial approximation\n",
    "In this notebook will be compared the values of mean and variance for the turbine efficiency using a Polynomial approximation: to this aim the method $\\textit{computeCoefficients} $ of $\\textit{Polyint}$ class has been used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 1: Evaluation of the polynomial Coefficients.\n",
    "This first part of the script aims to calculate the polynomial coefficients, starting from the definition of the turbine efficiency: the problem has four dimensions (two variables associated to the Inlet and Outlet Temperature and an other couple for the Inlet and Outlet Pressure) so a set of Uniform distributions has been created to generate an orthogonal basis; each distribution has been centered with respect to the mean value of the associated physical magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "A blackbox renamed $\\textit{efficiency}$ has been written to obtain the isotropic turbine efficiency; this later represents the input to the method $\\textit{ComputeCoefficients}$: the blackbox is tested over the range of values defined by the boundaries of the statistical distributions and the output is an array of polynomial coefficients for the numerical approximation."
