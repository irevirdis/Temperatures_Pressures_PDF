this directory contains:

1) the test script for the pdf behaviour in the case of uncorrelated
points and in the correlated (using Nataf)space.
- pdf_plot.py is the copy of turbine2_ps_edit.

2) the test script to test the efficiency mean values as function of 
the correlation between pressures and temperatures, given a 
fixed correlation coefficient between characteristics.
- efficiency_plot.py

3) the test script to check efficiency variations when temperatures
and pressures are mapped from correlated space to a standard space
- mapping_points.py

the script turbine2_ps.py calculates and compare efficiency in the
cases in which temperatures and pressures are samples of a MonteCarlo
method or points of a quadrature rule.
 
4) the script to test the efficiency deviation values as function of
correlation between pressures and temperatures, given a fixed 
correlation coefficient between characteristics.
- efficiency_variance.py
