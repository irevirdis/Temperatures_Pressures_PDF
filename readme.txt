this directory contains the test script for 
the pdf behaviour in the case of uncorrelated
points and in the correlated (using Nataf) 
space.
- pdf_plot.py is the copy of turbine2_ps_edit.
- pdf_plot_2.py has been written to test
  different values of mean for temperatures
  and pressures. (because a truncated gaussian
  should be found, and the original values of
  temperatures and pressure does not allow to
  find out a truncanted-gaussian behaviour)
